  "description": "Shipwrecked on the remote island of Fovea, Captain Duffy—a weathered sailor with a rough past—expects only solitude among the butterflies and spirit crabs. But when a catastrophic explosion at sea casts a young woman onto his shore, their days of shared survival awaken something profound in the gruff sea captain. As rescue approaches and the outside world closes in, Duffy must confront the insurmountable divide between a life forged at sea and the genteel world she belongs to. A haunting tale of missed chances and unspoken devotion, set against the vast loneliness of the South China Sea.",
